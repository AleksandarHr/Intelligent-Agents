To make the eclipse work I did:
 - import the existing eclipse project found in lastname directory
 - remove the TA's repast jar library from the project's properties
 - downloaded RePast J 3.1 and run ant repast to build it
 - went to the *workspace* settings, under Java > Build Path > User Libraries
   + create a new user library, named it repast
   + added the homebuilt repast.jar file (RepastJ/build/repast.jar) to this new library
   + and added the whole lot of jar files from RepastJ/build/lib too
 - then in the *project* settings, I added the repast user library as a dependency
 - at this point eclipse doesn't complain anymore and the project should run fine
